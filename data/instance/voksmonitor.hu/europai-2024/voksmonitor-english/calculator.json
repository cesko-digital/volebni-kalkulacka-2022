  "intro": "The aim of Voksmonitor is to enable voters to engage with politics not only through party communication - but also to learn about the different parties' manifestos and positions on key professional-political issues. The app finds the party that is closest to the respondent's values based on their answers.\n\n The questions were sent to the most likely parties running in the EP elections before the app was created. All parties responded to our request except Fidesz-KDNP. K-Monitor based its answers on the votes of Fidesz-KDNP MPs, the party's platform and communication. Voksmonitor is a joint project of K-Monitor and KohoVolit.eu."
