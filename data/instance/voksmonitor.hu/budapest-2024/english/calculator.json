  "intro": "Voksmonitor aims to ensure that voters encounter politics not only through daily political communication but also become acquainted with the positions of candidates on the most important policy issues.\n\n The application matches respondents with the candidate who, based on their responses, is closest to the respondent's value system. The questions were sent by K-Monitor to all mayoral candidates.\n\n Except for Szentkirályi Alexandra, all candidates responded to our inquiry. In the case of Szentkirályi, the responses were based on the actions and communications of Fidesz-KDNP.  Voksmonitor is a joint project of K-Monitor and KohoVolit.eu."
